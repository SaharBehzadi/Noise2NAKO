The environment has major impacts on human health, and particularly adverse effects are projected to increase within urban environments. Therefore, sophisticated geostatistical and data science models are urgently needed to better reflect real-life exposures and understand the long-term impact of environmental factors on human health. By joining the complementary expertise and data of HMGU and DLR, these impacts are targeted exemplary in the domain of noise. First, spatial limitations of state of the art noise maps are tackled using a unique noise mapping approach based on generous data augmentation and deep convolutional networks. Then, this data will be linked to socio-economic and demographic information from more than 200.000 participants of the German national cohort (NAKO) to identify vulnerable clusters in terms of noise and neighborhood factors for the risk of hypertension exploring distribution regression networks. Then, these clusters will be predicted for the whole of Germany. Finally, this network will be enhanced by auxiliary individual
socio-economic and health data to investigate the interplay of noise levels, neighborhood characteristics and individual risk factors on hypertension. We therefore apply and advance machine learning techniques considering also interpretable approaches. The innovative AI/ML methods developed within this project shall serve as case studies for the modeling of additional health endpoints as well as additional environmental parameters like air pollution, temperature/heat waves and relative humidity as these data are currently only available with strong limitations.
